### Yet Another Job Board

Made for one remote working job board.

## Intro
This website was made long time ago and previously kept as private repo. I made
it open sourced coz I did not have too much time to get it fully up. Simple Rails
project, most of features are supported by RoR and all kind of Gems.

## Setup
```
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed (optional)
bundle exec rails server
```

## Features
* support both English & Chinese
* advanced editor support
* ...

## TODO
* Search (I did add search support in [another website](https://github.com/whywhy36/SearchMagnet))
* ...
